Welcome to bAmazon Application (mySQL and node.js)

This was a great homework not only for learning mySQL but also for attaching node.js application to backend database.

Once you start application, it will display list of products and their price as follows
I will buy 10 TVs. Compare two snapshots of data 8:51 pm and 8:54 pm. The quantity has gone from 130 to 120.
Now, I will try to buy 800 TVs! See what happens. Also, compare 2 screen shots of tables.
